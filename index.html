                <strong>Summary:</strong> Once you've placed an order, you might
                no longer be able to edit the order details or cancel it. If you
                have an issue with the shipment of your order, contact us within
                30 days of the delivery or estimated delivery date. In some
                cases, you may need to reach out to the shipping carrier
                directly. <br /><br />
                Once you have confirmed your order, it might not be possible to
                edit or cancel it. If you want to change some parameters,
                Customer addresses, etc., please check whether such an option is
                available in your account. We are not bound to make such
                modifications to your order, but we will do our best on a
                case-by-case basis.

                The risk of loss of, damage to and title for Products pass to
                you upon our delivery to the carrier. It shall be your (if you
                are a User) or your Customer's (if you are a Merchant)
                responsibility to file any claim with a carrier for a lost
                shipment if carrier tracking indicates that the Product was
                delivered. In such case Printful will not make any refunds and
                will not resend the Product. For Users in the European Economic
                Area or the United Kingdom, the risk of loss of, damage to and
                title for Products will pass to you when you or a third party
                indicated by you has acquired the physical possession of the
                Products.
                <br /><br />
                If carrier tracking indicates that a Product was lost in
                transit, you or your Customer may make a written claim for
                replacement of (or credit to the Member’s account for) the lost
                Product in compliance with Printful’s Return Policy. For
                Products lost in transit, all claims must be submitted no later
                than 30 days after the estimated delivery date. All such claims
                are subject to Printful investigation and sole discretion.

                The return address is set by default to the Printful facility.
                When we receive a returned shipment, an automated email
                notification will be sent to you. Unclaimed returns get donated
                to charity after 4 weeks. If Printful's facility isn't used as
                the return address, you would become liable for any returned
                shipments you receive.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Wrong Address</strong> - If you or your end customer
                provide an address that is considered insufficient by the
                courier, the shipment will be returned to our facility. You will
                be liable for reshipment costs once we have confirmed an updated
                address with you (if and as applicable).

                <br /><br />
                <strong>Unclaimed</strong> - Shipments that go unclaimed are
                returned to our facility and you will be liable for the cost of
                a reshipment to yourself or your end customer (if and as
                applicable). <br /><br />
                If you haven't registered an account on printful.com and added a
                billing method, you hereby agree that any returned orders due to
                the wrong shipping address or a failure to claim the shipment
                won’t be available for reshipping and will be donated to charity
                at your cost (without us issuing a refund).
                <br /><br />
                Printful does not accept returns of sealed goods, such as but
                not limited to face masks, which are not suitable for return due
                to health or hygiene reasons. You hereby agree that any returned
                orders with face masks won’t be available for reshipping and
                will be disposed of.
                <br /><br />
                Returned by Customer - It is best to advise your end customers
                to contact you before returning any products. Except for
                Customers residing in Brazil, we do not refund orders for
                buyer’s remorse. Returns for products, face masks, as well as
                size exchanges are to be offered at your expense and discretion.
                If you choose to accept returns or offer size exchanges to your
                end customers, you would need to place a new order at your
                expense for a face mask or a product in another size. Customers
                residing in Brazil and regretting a purchase must contact our
                Customer Service and express their will to return the item
                within 7 consecutive days after receiving it, providing a
                picture of the item. The withdrawal request will undergo an
                evaluation to verify whether the product was used or destroyed,
                even if partial. In these cases, a refund will not be possible.
                <br /><br />
                Notification for EU consumers: According to Article 16(c) and
                (e) of the Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and
                of the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights, the right
                of withdrawal may not be provided for:
                <br /><br />
                1. the supply of goods that are made to the consumer's
                specifications or are clearly personalized; <br />
                2. sealed goods which were unsealed after delivery and thus
                aren't suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene
                reasons,
                <br /><br />
                therefore Printful reserves rights to refuse returns at its sole
                discretion.
